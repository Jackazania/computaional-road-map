# \# My Computational Design Roadmap

# 

# This is my personal website to track my computational design learning journey.

# 

# \## 🌟 What This Is

# A private roadmap to become a computational design expert in architecture.

# 

# \## 📍 My Starting Point

# \- Wits University Architecture Student (Year 2)

# \- Skills: Revit, QGIS, Photoshop

# \- Goal: MSc at top international universities

# \- Interest: Parametric design + structural engineering

# 

# \## 🎯 My 2026 Goals

# 1\. Master Grasshopper for parametric design

# 2\. Learn Python for computational design

# 3\. Build portfolio of computational projects

# 4\. Get internship at computational design firm

# 5\. Prepare for MSc applications

# 

# \## 🛠️ How to Use This Website

# 1\. Click on months to see what to learn

# 2\. Check off tasks as I complete them

# 3\. Watch my skill bars grow

# 4\. Print sections for offline reference

#
